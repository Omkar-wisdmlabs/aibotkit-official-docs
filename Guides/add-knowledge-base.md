# 📚 Building Your Knowledge Base

## What is a Knowledge Base?

Think of your Knowledge Base as your chatbot's "brain food" - it's all the information you feed to your AI assistant so it can answer questions intelligently about your business, products, services, or any topic you want it to know about.

**Why is this important?** Without a knowledge base, your chatbot can only provide generic answers. With a well-built knowledge base, it becomes a smart assistant that knows everything about YOUR specific business and content.
